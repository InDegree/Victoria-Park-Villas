                            <p>In designing for Victoria Park Villas, we aimed to maximise the feeling of space and light. For example, we chose lighted colours for the interiors, using oak floors, light grey marble, white timber veneered doors, and white glass kitchen cabinets. The overall effect is a light and bright modern house that would appeal to the most discerning of clients.  </p>

                                        <p>The plot on which the Courtyard Bungalow sits on is a triangulated piece of land perched on a high point. The design of the Courtyard Bungalow, therefore, tries to capitalise on the views over the site. For the Courtyard Bungalow, the site is a long linear plot with a discreet and quiet frontage. In our design, we created intimate courtyards where the living spaces can look into.</p>
